		<b>"The journey of thousand miles begins with a single step”</b>

		<p>The above-mentioned is the quote that inspires and reroutes anyone with a humongous task on hand. This is the first step ,the first post of many to follow.</p>

		<p>I have been struggling for hours to come up with a name for my blog which was relevant to me (and of course, not taken by other bloggers). After a lot of introspection and vacillating around, I came up with “The Silent Monk’s Retreat”. A silent monk, though calm and in peace on the surface of his shell, might have the most brilliant of thoughts and ideas. It takes no genius to see that I am using the silent monk as a metaphor to my existence. And this here, is my retreat, my mountain to shout at. The genre of posts here will vary a lot, be it technical, philosophical, inspirational or personal opinions, struggles and developments or be it short and long stories. I will write it all</p>

		<p>Now who am I?</p>

		<p>Fun fact about the quote at the beginning of this post, It is a vague westernised translation of a quote by Lao Tzu or Laozi (The author of ” The art of war”) . Now Lao Tzu is just a  pen name  which roughly translates to “old master”. I ask myself this question: Should I follow his lead and stay masked ; behind a psuedo-name?  I think not, I believe that if you have the bravado to express your thoughts then you must possess the guts to be the face.</p>

		<p>My name is Pranav Garg, I am (as in May of 2017) a  second year undergraduate student who is pursuing his Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering  from Birla Institute of Technology and Sciences, K.K. Birla Goa campus.</p>

		<p>When it comes to academia ,I am very passionate about artificial intelligence and currently obsessed with deep learning. I dream of making significant contributions to Artificial General intelligence some day. My journey began with one of the most revered and fundamental course in Machine learning by Professor Andrew NG on Coursera , and then it led to Artificial intelligence where I am learning about many diverse but connected field such as Machine learning, Computer vision, Neuroscience (theoretical and cognitive) and much more.</p>

		<p>Curiosity has always been the driving force for me, when I come across a problem I leave no stone unturned. I am an avid gamer (A huge Legend of Zelda fan)  and an ardent writer (as you are going to witness).</p>

		<p>An interesting human life can never be expressed in just a few lines, and if it is possible to express it in a few lines then it is just not interesting. So instead taking the impossible task of expressing my existence through just my observations and words, I will let you walk in my shoes and see through my perspective via my posts.</p>

		<p>Though I try to express myself to my limit everyday, a lot of what I want to express remains unspoken. So between what I want to express and whats expressed by me, I am relatively silent and distant.This here is my blog, my abyss to shout at .This here is my retreat. And this post is my first step in a thousand mile journey.</p>
